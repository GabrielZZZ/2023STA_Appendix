1.  **User: Give me five metamorphic relations (MRs) for testing the
    parking module of autonomous driving systems (ADSs)**

    **ChatGPT:** Sure, here are five MRs for testing the parking module
    of autonomous driving systems:

    -   MR1: Change in starting position This MR involves changing the
        starting position of the car before parking. The expected
        behavior is that the car should be able to detect the new
        position and park accordingly.

    -   MR2: Change in parking spot size. This MR involves changing the
        size of the parking spot. The expected behavior is that the car
        should be able to adjust its parking maneuver to fit in the new
        spot size.

    -   MR3: Change in parking lot layout. This MR involves changing the
        layout of the parking lot. The expected behavior is that the car
        should be able to detect the changes and adjust its parking
        maneuver accordingly.

    -   MR4: Change in obstacle position. This MR involves changing the
        position of obstacles in the parking lot. The expected behavior
        is that the car should be able to detect the new position of the
        obstacles and park accordingly.

    -   MR5: Change in weather conditions. This MR involves changing the
        weather conditions, such as rain or snow. The expected behavior
        is that the car should be able to adjust its parking maneuver to
        account for the slippery surface or reduced visibility.

2.  **User: You should include the input relations and output relations

            visibility due to the changed weather conditions, resulting
            in a final parking position that is appropriate for the new
            conditions.

4.  **User: the expression "resulting in a final parking position that
    is appropriate for the new conditions.\" is vague. Make it clearer
    for each MR**

    **ChatGPT:** Certainly! Here are the updated expected behaviors for
    each MR that make the final parking position more specific:

    -   MR1: Change in starting position

        -   Expected behavior: The car should adjust its parking
            maneuver to account for the change in the initial position
            and park accordingly, resulting in a final parking position
            that is appropriate for the new starting position. For
            example, if the starting position is closer to the edge of
            the parking lot, the final parking position should be
            adjusted to avoid hitting any objects or pedestrians.

    -   MR2: Change in parking spot size

        -   Expected behavior: The car should adjust its parking
            maneuver to fit in the new spot size, resulting in a final
            parking position that is appropriate for the new spot size.
            For example, if the parking spot is larger, the car should
            park closer to the center of the spot to avoid leaving too
            much space on either side.

    -   MR3: Change in parking lot layout

        -   Expected behavior: The car should adjust its parking
            maneuver to account for the changes in the parking lot
            layout and park accordingly, resulting in a final parking
            position that is appropriate for the new layout. For
            example, if the parking lot layout changes to include
            diagonal parking spaces, the car should adjust its parking
            angle accordingly.

    -   MR4: Change in obstacle position

        -   Expected behavior: The car should adjust its parking
            maneuver to account for the new position of the obstacles
            and park accordingly, resulting in a final parking position
            that is appropriate for the new obstacle position. For
            example, if an obstacle is now positioned closer to the
            parking space, the car should park farther away from the
            obstacle to avoid hitting it.

    -   MR5: Change in weather conditions

        -   Expected behavior: The car should adjust its parking
            maneuver to account for the slippery surface or reduced
            visibility due to the changed weather conditions, resulting
            in a final parking position that is appropriate for the new
            conditions. For example, if the surface is slippery due to
            rain, the car should park more slowly and cautiously to
            avoid slipping or sliding.

5.  **User: You miss the input and output relations**

    **ChatGPT:** I apologize for the confusion. Here are the updated
    input and output relations for each MR, along with the clearer
    expected behaviors:

    -   MR1: Change in starting position

        -   Input relation: Original starting position (x,y) and new
            starting position (x',y')

        -   Expected behavior: The car should adjust its parking
            maneuver to account for the change in the initial position
            and park accordingly, resulting in a final parking position
            (x",y") that is appropriate for the new starting position.
            For example, if the starting position is closer to the edge
            of the parking lot, the final parking position should be
            adjusted to avoid hitting any objects or pedestrians.

    -   MR2: Change in parking spot size

        -   Input relation: Original parking spot size (length, width)

            maneuver to account for the slippery surface or reduced
            visibility due to the changed weather conditions, resulting
            in a final parking position (x",y") that is appropriate for
            the new conditions. For example, if the surface is slippery
            due to rain, the car should park more slowly and cautiously
            to avoid slipping or sliding.
